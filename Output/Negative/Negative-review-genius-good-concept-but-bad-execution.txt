Poor direction, lackluster screenplay and many illogical sequences spoil this movie. There are many loose ends in the plot – For eg, the way the celebrities have been kidnapped has not been shown convincingly. They are just snatched away with ease.

There are too many songs in the first half and they all come in at very wrong moments, disrupting the flow of the film.

A lot of prominent actors like Nagababu, Annapoorna, K. Vishwanadh etc have been wasted in poorly etched roles that have no meaning.

There is no logical flow in narration and one gets the feeling that the director completely lost the plot. There are too many distractions like a badly conceived romantic track between Nivas and Sri.

There is no emotional intensity in the sequences where the revenge killings take place.

Ohmkkar’s justification in the end for using the title ‘Genius’ is neither credible nor logical.
