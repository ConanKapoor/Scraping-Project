Climax is a let down as Maruthi chooses a very cleashed and ordinary ending. He could have ended the film on a simple note but chooses the typical commercial path and adds unnecessary fights and silly thrills. Ajayâ€™s character looks forced and goes over the top many a times.

The conflict point of the film is hurried on during the pre-climax. Certain logics regarding the memory loss concept have been overlooked in the film. The title song of the film could have been totally removed to make the film crisp.<br/>
