Sarath Kumar has delivered a nice and powerful performance in the film and he tries his best to liven up proceedings. Brahmanandam entertains to a certain extent with a cameo appearance as Pandu, a dance fanatic.

Havish has done well during the serious episodes of the movie, but he has carried just one single expression throughout the film. Sanusha looks good in the movie as Sri, Havishâ€™s love interest. Ashish Vidyardhi and Pradeep Rawat have done a decent job. Happy Days fame Adarsh looked quite stylish as cricketer Nizamuddin.

Basic concept and intention of the film is laudable. Anita Hassanandani sizzles in one item number and Scarlett Wislon.
